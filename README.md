# NUMBER PLATE DETECTION OF VEHICLES 
## Problem Statement 
Manual identification of vehicle number plates from surveillance or traffic images is 
inefficient and error-prone. With increasing vehicles and road surveillance, there is a need for 
an automated system that can accurately detect and read number plates from images or video 
frames. 
## Tools & Technologies Used 
1. Python 
2. OpenCV – Image processing and edge detection 
3. EasyOCR – Optical character recognition 
4. Matplotlib – Visualization of results 
5.Canny Edge Detection – Preprocessing step 
6. Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook – Development environment
## Future Enhancements 
1. Integrate deep learning models (e.g., YOLO) for better plate localization. 
2. Enable real-time number plate detection with video streams. 
3. Add validation for detected text to match number plate formats. 
4. Implement automatic alerts for suspicious or blacklisted vehicles. 
## Conclusion 
The project successfully detects and extracts number plate text from vehicle images 
using OpenCV and EasyOCR. It provides a foundation for automated vehicle identification 
systems and can be further improved with advanced detection and real-time capabilities.
